* Hey! I want to reserve a restaurant for tonight. Id love to eat sushi!
   - No problem! Lets make you that reservation! Ill look up sushi joints!
* Thank you!
   - Okay, it looks like the two best options for reservations for tonight are _name.restaurant_ on _location.restaurant_ or _name.restaurant_ in _location.restaurant_.
* Hmm, whats the seating like at both?
   - It looks like _name.restaurant_ is _type.seating_ and _name.restaurant_ has options for _type.seating_, _type.seating_, and _type.seating_
* What about ambiance?
   - _name.restaurant_ is well lit and open, they usually have music playing. _name.restaurant_, depending on where youre seated, looks darker and more romantic, but with a kind of fancy bar feel.
* Hmm, how do the reviews match up?
   - _name.restaurant_ has four out of five stars, with many compliments toward the wait staff and positive comments about the plating of the meal. _name.restaurant_ has a _number_ out of _number_ stars and says the wait staff can be a little short when its busy but that the food is divine and the service is fast.
* Okay, so for parking, what are my options?
   - _name.restaurant_ has a parking lot, _name.restaurant_ is right _location.restaurant_ so youll want to pay for parking and arrive early or get a car to take you there.
* Its weird, I must be leaning towards _name.restaurant_, because I dont really mind the parking inconvenience. Could you make reservations for _num.guests_ at Seven for me tonight?
   - Absolutely I can. Do you want to be at _name.restaurant_ at _time.reservation_ or something a little less, lets say, conspicuous?
* Id like to do tonight at around _time.reservation_, preferably.
   - Okay, let me check. What kind of seating do you want?
* Can I get _type.seating_?
   - Let me see here...it looks like theres no available _type.seating_ for _time.reservation_. What do you want to do?
* When is the next time I could get that seating?
   - Not until the sushi stops being served and its just drinks.
* Okay, thats not going to work. Is there just an upper level table for _num.guests_ thats not _type.seating_?
   - Looks like if you push the dinner to _time.reservation_, they will have just that for you!
* Okay, quick, book it before someone else does.
   - Alright, your reservation has been made for _time.reservation_ at _name.restaurant_. _num.guests_, table on the second floor. Checkin name?
* _name.reservation_.
   - Perfect. Ill send you the details in a text and also get that confirmation to you via email. Sound good?
* Sounds wonderful, thank you!
   - No problem! Enjoy your evening.

* Excellent. What time of the day do I need to bring it in?
   - They recommend that you bring it in when they first open. Which is at _time.appt_.
* Did they say how long itll take to fix it?
   - They want to do an inspection first, then they will give you a quote. If they have to order a new part, it might take them up to a week. If its a simple fix, they could have the whole thing done by the next day. They said it might be dangerous to drive your car with the _reason.appt_ and suggested that you have it toed to the shop. Would you like me to call a toeing company?
* I wouldnt. Ill take my risks and see what happens. Can you confirm the details with me about _date.appt_ appointment?
   - Yes sir. _name.customer_, take your _year.vehicle_ _name.vehicle_name.store_name.vehicle_ on _location.store_ _date.appt_ at _time.appt_. Expect to have no vehicle anywhere from one day to a week. They will be fixing your _reason.appt_. Since you wont have a vehicle, would you like me to find a car rental company for you? By the way, I took the liberty of giving them your phone number in case they need to contact you.
* No thanks. Ill be carpooling for the time I dont have a car.
   - Is there anything else that I can do for you in relation to this matter?

   - Uber and Lyft are very similar in pricing.
* OK, then Lyft seems to be the logical choice.
   - How much luggage do you have?
* Why do you ask?
   - We need to determine which size vehicle youll need.

   - Do you know how to use the Lyft app?
* Ive never used it before.
   - Do you have the app installed on your phone?
* No, I dont think so.

* And then what?

* So Ally, I have been thinking about getting all the ladies together for some fine dining.I need a restaurant that has good food and a bar for some drinks after.
   - Oh, Exciting! OK - are you thinking walk in or a nicer place that needs reservations?
* Definitely reservations , I really do not like standing around waiting, and eating before drinks is important.
   - Do you want some place you have been before like _name.restaurant_?
* That was an awesome time,I loved the skyline view and eating on the deck.I am actually wanting a new spot,like actually new to all of us.Girl, get to work I am ready!
   - Are we staying in Cincinnati? If so they do have a place called _name.restaurant_ which has _type.seating_ seating.Best of all it is reservation only, with American food with a touch classy.So you get the table of your choice ,the food you love,a bar and we can dance under the stars.
* You are a great assistant.Lets book it.
   - Calling now, I need a date and time and how many of us will be there.
* Um... Lets do the first Saturday in May _time.reservation_.It should be for at least _num.guests_ people see if we can reserve a slightly larger table in case someone else wants to join.
   - I am still on hold, oo here they are hold on a minute.
* After this go ahead and get the invitations out, so the group can plan accordingly.
   - We have slight problem with the date.The date you want is not available we can do the Saturday before or maybe the one after.
* Ugh, OK let me think quickly. I want it to be decent weather so lets push it out one week.Is everything else available? The _type.seating_ is mandatory.
   - Everything is good to go. They did change the table size instead of a table for _number_ they did the table for _num.guests_ with extra chairs , if we have _number_ they will add a table.
* That is perfect !!!!
   - How would you like the invitations? How about we do a theme get together, make it fun spice things up.
* Wow, you are a the best assistant  friend anyone could have.I am going to et you decide all the fun factors,you just let me know before sending out the final email.
   - Absolutely , working on this now. I have a few ideas.
* Jot them down, add in some detail for each and we can decide together.
   - I think this will be the greatest group get together of the year.

* I want to book an Italian restaurant for a business meeting. I want it to be somewhere fancy. Reservation required and all that.
   - Let me think...there’s _name.restaurant_ and _name.restaurant_, they’re both in _location.restaurant_.
* How far are they from my office?
   - Close enough to walk, if you wanted.
* Do either have _type.seating_? I feel like that would help me seal this business deal.
   - _name.restaurant_ is mostly _type.seating_. _name.restaurant_ is _type.seating_ only.
* I’m leaning towards _name.restaurant_. What’s the wine menu like at both?
   - _name.restaurant_ has only a few wines available—mostly house reds—but the reviews of the wine are great. _name.restaurant_ has pretty much anything you could want, but it’s cheaper stuff.
* Well I want there to be variety but I also want it to be expensive. My partners have good taste. What’s the dessert menu like?
   - _name.restaurant_ meals automatically come with a dessert of your choice, prepared in house by a chef. _name.restaurant_ has a larger dessert menu but it looks like it is mostly frozen stuff.
* _name.restaurant_ it is, then. How far out do they accept reservations?
   - A year.
* Well I don’t need that long. Make me a reservation for two weeks from now—February _number_nd—at _time.reservation_. I’ll need _type.seating_ for _num.guests_.
   - Oh, no. It looks like there isn’t any _type.seating_ available at that time for a party that size....
* What else do they have?
   - They have _type.seating_ and _type.seating_, and _type.seating_.
* _type.seating_ wouldn’t be intimate enough, we wouldn’t be able to talk. Do you think _type.seating_ or _type.seating_ seating would be better?
   - Probably _type.seating_—it would be easier to talk business without feeling too boxed in.
* You’re right. Go ahead and book the _type.seating_
   - All right, you’re all set. You have a reservation at _name.restaurant_ for _time.reservation_ for _num.guests_ at a _type.seating_.
* Perfect. Thank you.

* Hello Jane, I hope your day is going fabulous. As you know we have the ExCom meeting going on and it ends tomorrow Friday.
   - Absolutely, Im aware. Anything I need to get in place?
* Certainly! The meeting ends tomorrow Friday and we need to take out this team to a sumptuous lunch buffet.
   - That would be fabulous. Do you have any cuisine preference for them?
* Well, I am not very sure for that, but I guess most of them would go with something Mexican or African. They seem to talk much about that.
   - Fabulous! And do you have any hotel preferences?
* Well, I leave that homework for you. What options do we have?
   - Certainly, I can handle that. We have a couple of great places in town.
* I just need at least _number_ then I can pick one.
   - Certainly! We have the _name.restaurant_ that serves amazing variety. They stand out for their great Mexican dishes and fine beer.
* Do they also serve traditional African meals?
   - No, they do not do that, but there is a splendid African restaurant about _number_ miles from here. They serve great East and West African dishes.
* Aha, so which option suits us?
   - How many people do we have for the lunch? I need to know how many tables to book.
* We have a total of _num.guests_.
   - Do you prefer one _type.seating_ or _type.seating_?
* Give us one _type.seating_ that can take everyone.
   - Well in that case then perhaps the Mexican restaurant will be the best option for the team because the African place can only do multiple _type.seating_.
* Wow, and what will we do with the folks who insist they want some African restaurant experience? Can we have the Mexican make some African dishes for us?
   - Well, am not sure about that but I can find out.
* Awesome! And we will have some folks taking beer and smoking, so have that in the list.
   - Superb! The Mexican provides for the bar, but disallows smoking. The African restaurant does allow for both.
* Well, sounds like we gonna have to go Mexican, though we will have trouble smoking.
   - Ok, great. I think Mexican stands out here.
* Superb! Please proceed.
